Five passionate developers sat in a small café, frustrated by the endless phone calls and missed appointments they witnessed businesses struggling with every day. \"There has to be a better way,\" said Etrit, and that spark of an idea would soon become Appointly-ks.",
      "p2": "What began as late-night coding sessions and endless cups of coffee quickly evolved into something bigger. Lerdi brought his expertise in AI integration, dreaming of a chatbot that could handle bookings as naturally as a human receptionist. Fatlum, Jasin, and Marjan worked tirelessly on building a rock-solid backend that could handle thousands of appointments without breaking a sweat.",
