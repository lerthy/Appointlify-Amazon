## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

- **AIChatbotDemoPage.tsx**: Demo page showcasing the chatbot functionality

### Backend API Endpoints

- **POST /api/chat**: Processes chat messages through OpenAI API
- **POST /api/book-appointment**: Handles appointment booking (mock implementation)

## üîÑ Integration with Your Existing System

### Service Integration

The AI chatbot automatically adapts to your existing services. To integrate with your actual services:

1. Pass your real services to the `AIChatbot` component:

```tsx
<AIChatbot
  businessName="Your Business Name"
  services={yourServices} // Array of service objects
  availableTimes={yourAvailableTimes} // Array of time strings
  onBookingReady={handleBooking} // Custom booking handler
/>
```

### Booking Integration

Replace the mock booking endpoint in `server.js` with your actual booking logic:

```javascript
app.post('/api/book-appointment', async (req, res) => {
  // Replace this with your actual booking system integration
  const result = await yourBookingSystem.createAppointment(req.body);
  res.json(result);
});
```

## üé® Customization

### Styling

The chatbot uses Tailwind CSS classes. You can customize:

- Colors: Change `bg-blue-600` to your brand colors
- Size: Modify `w-96 h-[500px]` for different dimensions
- Position: Adjust `bottom-6 right-6` for different placement

### AI Personality

Modify the system prompt in `/api/chat` endpoint to change the AI's personality:

```javascript
const systemPrompt = `You are [your custom personality description]...`;
```

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

The chatbot is fully responsive and works on:

- Desktop browsers
- Mobile devices
- Tablets

## üîê Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ No API keys exposed to frontend
- ‚úÖ CORS properly configured
- ‚úÖ Input validation on backend endpoints
