# OpenAI Setup Guide for Your Chatbot

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Add a payment method at [Billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
4. Create an API key at [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
5. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)

### 2. Update Your .env File

Once you have your API key, update your `.env` file:

```env
# Replace this line in your .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# With your actual API key:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-api-key-here

# Enable OpenAI (change from false to true):
USE_OPENAI=true
```

### 3. Restart Your Server

```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C if running in foreground)
# Then restart:
npm run server
```

### 4. Test OpenAI Connection

```bash
node test-openai.js
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ OpenAI connection successful!
ü§ñ AI Response: [OpenAI response]
```

- Share API keys publicly
- Commit API keys to Git
- Use API keys in frontend code

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error
- Double-check the API key is copied correctly
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters
- Make sure the key starts with `sk-proj-` or `sk-`

- Check your billing page for remaining credits
- Add more credits or set up auto-recharge
- Verify your usage limits

### "Rate Limit" Error
- You're sending requests too quickly
- Add delays between requests if needed
- Upgrade to higher tier for more requests

## Current Fallback System

Your chatbot already has a smart fallback system:

1. **Primary**: Tries OpenAI API (when configured)
2. **Fallback**: Uses mock AI service (if OpenAI fails)
3. **Always Works**: Your chatbot never goes down!

## Testing Your Setup

### Test Commands

```bash
# Test OpenAI connection
node test-openai.js

# Test the chat API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"context":{}}'
```

### Expected Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Hello! How can I help you book an appointment today?",
  "provider": "openai",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 120,
    "completion_tokens": 15,
    "total_tokens": 135
  }
}
```
